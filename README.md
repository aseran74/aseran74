## 🚀 What I Do

I build **early-stage products and MVPs** with a strong focus on speed, usability, and real user value.

My background in **graphic design and UI/UX** allows me to translate ideas into clear, functional interfaces, prioritizing what matters most at early stages: **validate fast, iterate faster**, and avoid over-engineering.

I'm comfortable working with limited resources, evolving requirements, and direct user feedback — taking ownership from concept to deployment.

## 🌱 Startup Experience — Pre-Seed

I've worked on and launched multiple projects that have been reviewed by incubators and early-stage ecosystems, gaining hands-on experience in **idea validation, MVP development, and pitch preparation**.

### Projects:
- **Holydeo.com** — early-stage digital platform
- **Quincenalia.com** — product focused on recurring value & engagement
- **Jubilalia.com** — age-focused solution with usability-first approach
- **Rutify.app** — mobile-first product built with MVP principles (Capacitor)

Across these projects, I've contributed to:
- MVP definition & scope reduction
- Frontend architecture & UI decisions
- Rapid iteration based on feedback
- Pre-seed pitch readiness
- **Mobile app deployment** using Capacitor

## 🧠 How I Work (Founder-Friendly)

- **Bias toward execution** over theory
- Strong sense of **ownership and responsibility**
- **Design + development mindset** (not just "make it work", but "make it usable")
- Comfortable working **solo or in small teams**
- Used to **real users, real constraints, and real deadlines**

I also drive for Uber, which reinforces daily skills in **time management, autonomy, prioritization, and customer interaction** — directly transferable to early-stage environments.
